# SATSolver
Very simple SAT Solver for easy sets of predicates
Made during a course about logic at UiO (University i Oslo)

Lacks many things to be a proper SAT Solver but solves sets of predicates when each set has the same amount of predicates.
Example: Can solve {{a, b}, {NOT a, NOT b}} but might not solve {{a, b}, {a}}
